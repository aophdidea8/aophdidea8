Live acts include noisy THE OTHER TRIBE, electronic duo PERSONAL SPACE INVADERS, the gorgeous WOLFETTE and Indie boys YO YO ESKIMO. Plus DJ sets in the bar from trio CONCRETE DISCO, dirty disco STUPIDRICHKIDZ, 80s influenced LUXAR and SKILOW.   <br \/><br \/>Main Hall<br \/><br \/>THE OTHER TRIBE (LIVE) \u2013 It starts with darkness; smoke fills the room, and drums start a hypnotic pulse. By the time you\u2019ve heard those drums, it\u2019s too late. Six silhouettes emerge from the dim and from there you\u2019re in for the most exhilarating, chaotic set of your life. Thrashing percussion, filthy dub step, throbbing sub-bass, screaming guitars and house and techno beats are united in the chant-laden songs of this genre defying and defining tribe. <br \/><br \/>PERSONALSPACE INVADERS (LIVE) \u2013 Angular guitar, compulsive bass, seething electronics, forceful vocals coupled with a storming backbeat-this is the sound of a young, modern and international London, captured brilliantly by Personal Space Invaders. PSI want you to dance and sweat and leave with their hooks invading your head. <br \/><br \/>WOLFETTE (LIVE) - Part English rose, part fiery Thai, and a distant relative of Virginia Woolf, Wolfette is a dark new force in the world of electro-rock- pop. Armed with tales of crazy nights, illicit passion and betrayal, and backed by Icelandic producer Gisli Kristjansson, she has created a powerful sound of dirty guitar riffs, driving basslines and all things electro.<br \/> <br \/>YO YO ESKIMO (LIVE) - Yoyo Eskimo make emotionally honest, intelligent, indie-pop music. Melding their love of classic electro with their passion for American indie and their appreciation for anything out of the ordinary; the London four-piece weave a truly original blanket of sound around their atmospheric lyrics and seductive beats.<br \/><br \/>In The Bar<br \/><br \/>If live music isn\u2019t your thing then the best of Human Error\u2019s resident DJs and guests entertain in the bar. This month\u2019s DJs are live electro trio CONCRETE DISCO, dirty disco STUPIDRICHKIDZ, 80s influenced LUXAR and SKILOW. Think big party dance tunes in various forms of Electro, Disco and House with a splash of Pop for those sing-a-long choruses.    <br \/><br \/>Web Links:<br \/><br \/>Human Error - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/home.php#!\/group.php?gid=211014208639\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com\/home.php#!\/group.php?gid=211014208639<\/a><br \/>The Other Tribe - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theothertribe\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com\/theothertribe<\/a><br \/>Personal Space Invaders - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/personalspaceinvaders\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.myspace.com\/personalspaceinvaders<\/a><br \/>Wolfette - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/wolfettemusic\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.myspace.com\/wolfettemusic<\/a><br \/>YoYo Eskimo - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yoyoeskimo.net\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.yoyoeskimo.net\/<\/a><br \/>Concrete Disco - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.concretedisco.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.concretedisco.com\/<\/a><br \/>Stupidrichkidz - <a href=\"http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/lukaslyrestam\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/lukaslyrestam<\/a><br \/>Luxar - <a href=\"http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/luxarmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/luxarmusic<\/a><br \/>Skilow - <a href=\"http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/skilow\/skilow-mix-blast-vol-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/skilow\/skilow-mix-blast-vol-1<\/a><\/div>","possible":true}]}
